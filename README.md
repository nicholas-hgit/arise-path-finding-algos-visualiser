# PATH-FINDING ALGORITHM VISUALIZER

<p>This is a simple path-finding algorithms visualization tool</p>

## IMPLEMENTED ALGORITHMS

### Depth-First Search(DFS)
<p>Explores the grid depth-first, using a stack to keep track of nodes to visit</p>

### Breadth-First Search(BFS)
<p>Explores the grid breadth-first, using a queue to keep track of nodes to visit</p>

### A*(A-star)
<p>Finds the shortest path using an informed search approach combining heuristics with distance costs</p>

## FEATURES
<p>Interactive grid-based graph visualization</p>
<p>Selectable start and goal nodes</p>
<p>Can add obstacles by clicking the nodes on the grid</p>
<p>Algorithm selection</p>
<p>Grid size selection</p>

</ul>

## NOTES
<p>This visualizer is intended for educational and algorithm practicing purposes</p>
<p>If you're also learning algorithms and Java and want to connect, feel free to add fixes, features, and more algorithms</p>
